# Release 2021.5.3

## New

* **openCollectiveIntegration package:** Adds links to [Patchfox OC](https://opencollective.com/patchfox) to the help menu.
* **documentation:** All _message types_ documentation is now dynamic and placed inside the package that handles them.

## Changes

* The _raw message_ view now includes more links to documentation.
* Changed the [browser polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) from a vendored copy to module from NPM.
* **Documentation:** The `message types` documentation is now dynamic. It is assembled from individual markdown files from each package. The documentation for each message type should be placed in `src/packages/<package name>/docs/message_types/<message type>.md`.

## Bugs

* **Calendar:** The validator for _gathering updates_ was very naive and has been replaced with a more robust one that uses [ssb-gathering-schema](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-gathering-schema).
* **GlobalMenu:** Added a check to display the _sidebar trigger_ only in browser that support `browser.sidebarAction.*` APIs.
